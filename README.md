# IS601-final-project
Converting my midterm project to NextJS.

* I used MUI ReactJS components to redesign the homepage.
* Improved the responsiveness of the design (MUI boxes were a pain to use though - definitely a learning curve).
* I removed the blue area on the logo (including the link).
* Added GitHub issues since I only had 32 on the midterm (I didn't fully understand user stories and issues when completing the midterm)

Unfortunately, time got the better of me due to the group final project, work, and other finals, but I truly have learned so much from this course! I now understand github workflows, html, css, ReactJS, NextJS, acceptance criteria, user stories, and key design concepts.

I don't see myself going into software development but I have already benefitted from this course in my career. My group in asset management is currently involved with developing asset health platforms due to the installations of state-of-the-art monitors. I have already stepped up in my role to be the spokesperson from my group as we provide our business needs, UI design preferences, etc., with IT folks. After taking this course and two more IS courses to follow, I will be in a position to step into a management role, so I am forever grateful for this kickstart.
